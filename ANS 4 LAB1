ANS 4:

Reverse engineering the provided code involves analyzing its structure, functionality, and dependencies to understand how it works.

1. Understanding the Purpose
   - Purpose: This project seems to be a hybrid file compression and encryption system. It allows compressing files using Huffman coding and then encrypting the compressed files using either AES or Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). Additionally, the system can decrypt and decompress files back to their original form.

2. Analyzing the Code Components
   - Huffman Coding (Compression/Decompression:
     - Node Class: Represents a node in the Huffman tree, containing a character, its frequency, and pointers to left and right children.
     - Min Heap Functions: `createAndBuildMin_Heap`, `buildMinHeap`, and `minHeapify` are responsible for creating and maintaining a min heap used in building the Huffman tree.
     - Huffman Tree Construction: `buildHuffmanTree` constructs the Huffman tree by repeatedly extracting the two nodes with the lowest frequency and combining them into a new node.
     - Generate Codes: `generateCodes` traverses the Huffman tree to generate binary codes for each character.
     - Compression: `compress` reads the input file, compresses it using the generated Huffman codes, and writes the compressed data to an output file.
     - Decompression: `decompress` reads the compressed file, reconstructs the Huffman codes, and decodes the data back to its original form.

   - Encryption (AES and ECC):
     - AES Encryption/Decryption:
       - AESEncrypt: Encrypts a file using AES-256-CBC. It generates a random key and IV, then encrypts the file and stores the encrypted data along with the key and IV.
       - AESDecrypt: Decrypts the AES-encrypted file using the stored key and IV.
     - ECC Encryption/Decryption:
       - EECEncrypt: Encrypts a file using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). The encrypted data and the symmetric key are stored.
       - EECDecrypt: Decrypts the ECC-encrypted file using the symmetric key.

   - MongoDB Schema:
     - Mongoose Schema: The project uses MongoDB to store information about decrypted files, including the decryption technique and file location.

3. Identifying Dependencies
   - Node.js Modules:
     - `fs`: File system module for reading/writing files.
     - `path`: Module for handling and transforming file paths.
     - `crypto`: Provides cryptographic functionality for encryption and decryption.
     - `mongoose`: MongoDB object modeling tool for managing data persistence.
   
 4. Reconstructing Design
   - Architecture:
     - The project follows a modular design, with separate modules for Huffman coding, AES, and ECC encryption/decryption.
     - The main flow involves reading a file, compressing it with Huffman coding, and then encrypting it with a chosen encryption technique.
     - The decompression and decryption processes work in reverse, decrypting first and then decompressing.

   - Data Flow:
     1. Compression: File content → Huffman coding → Compressed data.
     2. Encryption: Compressed data → AES/ECC → Encrypted file.
     3. Decryption: Encrypted file → AES/ECC decryption → Decompressed file.

   - Key Algorithms:
     - Huffman Coding: Used for lossless data compression.
     - AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): Symmetric encryption for data security.
     - ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography): Asymmetric encryption for secure key exchange.

 5. Potential Enhancements
   - Error Handling: Improve error handling, especially in file operations and encryption/decryption steps.
   - User Interface: Add a user-friendly interface (CLI or GUI) for easier operation.
   - Optimization: Optimize the min heap operations and Huffman tree construction for better performance on large files.

 6. Conclusion
The project is a well-structured implementation of file compression using Huffman coding, combined with encryption using AES or ECC. Reverse engineering this project reveals a clear flow from file compression to encryption, with modular functions handling each step effectively. Understanding the dependencies and data flow is crucial for maintaining or extending the project.
